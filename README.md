# Exploring Large Language Models

This repository dives deep into the world of generative AI using open-source transformer models like GPT. Our main goal is to build automated tools that harness the power of these language models to assist in a variety of business use cases.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. If not, [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Dependencies**: Install the required packages for the project.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Implementations

Here are the different implementations available in this repository:

### 1. RAG Implementation

- **Description**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that combines the power of large transformer language models with external retrieval or database mechanisms.
- **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run_localGPT.py
   ```

### 2. LLM Implementation

- **Description**: A basic Large Language Model generation.
- **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run_localllm.py
   ```

### 3. Agent Implementation

- **Description**: An AI Agent designed for handling tasks and interacting with computers.
- **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run_localPiggy.py
   ```

### 4. Experimental Implementation

- **Description**: This involves an iterative process using the Large Language Model in an attempt to achieve predefined goals.
- **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run_localALGO.py
   ```

### 5. Langchain Implementation

- **Description**: This section explores the `langchain` package and its capabilities to interact with Large Language Models.
- **Run**:
   ```bash
   python run_localBaby.py
   ```
